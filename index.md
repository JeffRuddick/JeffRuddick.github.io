*Compound interest is one of the most powerful forces in modern society.*  By visualizing the growth of an investment year by year, this project is designed to add realism to the abstract concept of compounding.

This includes the usual financial calculator variables such as principal, annual contribution, years invested, and interest rate. Click the visualize button and tap a flat surface.  Then, watch your investment grow year by year. 

### Features 
* Calculates compound interest 
* Visualize compound growth in augmented reality (Apple ARKit)
